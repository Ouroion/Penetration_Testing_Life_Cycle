# Project Title: Penetration Testing Life Cycle
Collaborating with student ----, my final project in CSCI 345, Computer and Network Security, covered the penetration testing life cycle as described in NIST SP 800-115, the Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment. The phases discussed in our project are as follows: Planning, Discovery, Attack, and Reporting. In our presentation itself, ---- and I addressed the purpose of each phase, some of the tools and techniques that can be used for each one, as well as post-testing activities that should be carried out to ensure the reporting and future mitigation of vulnerabilities found during testing. After going through the penetration testing life cycle phase-by-phase, I showed a short slideshow demonstration of how each phase, and their respective tools, can be put into practice during a small scale penetration test consisting of two computers on a subnet: The attacker (you) and the target machine (victim)
